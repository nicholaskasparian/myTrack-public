# prompting — Part 2


```
# The output from the REST API is a JSON object containing base64 encoded data.
# You can extract the text or the audio data using a tool like jq.
# To extract the audio and save it to a file:
curl ... | jq -r '.candidates[0].content.parts[] | select(.inlineData) | .inlineData.data' | base64 -d > output.mp3
```

## Generate music from images

Lyria 3 supports multimodal inputs — you can provide up to **10 images**
alongside your text prompt and the model will compose music inspired by the
visual content.

### Python

```
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("desert_sunset.jpg")

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="lyria-3-pro-preview",
    contents=[
        "An atmospheric ambient track inspired by the mood and "
        "colors in this image.",
        image,
    ],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=["AUDIO", "TEXT"],
    ),
)
```

### JavaScript

```
const imageData = fs.readFileSync("desert_sunset.jpg");
const base64Image = imageData.toString("base64");

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "lyria-3-pro-preview",
  contents: [
    { text: "An atmospheric ambient track inspired by the mood " +
            "and colors in this image." },
    {
      inlineData: {
        mimeType: "image/jpeg",
        data: base64Image,
      },
    },
  ],
  config: {
    responseModalities: ["AUDIO", "TEXT"],
  },
});
```

### Go

```
imgData, err := os.ReadFile("desert_sunset.jpg")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

parts := []*genai.Part{
    genai.NewPartFromText("An atmospheric ambient track inspired " +
        "by the mood and colors in this image."),
    &genai.Part{
        InlineData: &genai.Blob{
            MIMEType: "image/jpeg",
            Data:     imgData,
        },
    },
}

contents := []*genai.Content{
    genai.NewContentFromParts(parts, genai.RoleUser),
}

result, err := client.Models.GenerateContent(
    ctx,
    "lyria-3-pro-preview",
    contents,
    config,
)
```

### Java

```
GenerateContentResponse response = client.models.generateContent(
    "lyria-3-pro-preview",
    Content.fromParts(
        Part.fromText("An atmospheric ambient track inspired by "
            + "the mood and colors in this image."),
        Part.fromBytes(
            Files.readAllBytes(Path.of("desert_sunset.jpg")),
            "image/jpeg")),
    config);
```

### REST

```
curl -s -X POST \

  -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \

      ]
    }],
    \"generationConfig\": {
      \"responseModalities\": [\"AUDIO\", \"TEXT\"]
    }
  }"
```

### C#

```
var response = await client.Models.GenerateContentAsync(
  model: "lyria-3-pro-preview",
  contents: new List<Part> {
    Part.FromText("An atmospheric ambient track inspired by the mood and colors in this image."),
    Part.FromBytes(await File.ReadAllBytesAsync("desert_sunset.jpg"), "image/jpeg")
  },
  config: config
);
```

## Provide custom lyrics

You can write your own lyrics and include them in the prompt. Use section tags
like `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, and `[Bridge]` to help the model understand the
song structure:

### Python

```
prompt = """
Create a dreamy indie pop song with the following lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Walking through the neon glow,
city lights reflect below,
every shadow tells a story,
every corner, fading glory.

[Chorus]
We are the echoes in the night,
burning brighter than the light,
hold on tight, don't let me go,
we are the echoes down below.

[Verse 2]
Footsteps lost on empty streets,
rhythms sync to heartbeats,
whispers carried by the breeze,
dancing through the autumn leaves.
"""

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="lyria-3-pro-preview",

    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_modalities=["AUDIO", "TEXT"],

## Control timing and structure

You can specify exactly what happens at specific moments in the song using
timestamps. This is useful for controlling when instruments enter, when lyrics
are delivered, and how the song progresses:

### Python

```
prompt = """
[0:00 - 0:10] Intro: Begin with a soft lo-fi beat and muffled
              vinyl crackle.
[0:10 - 0:30] Verse 1: Add a warm Fender Rhodes piano melody
              and gentle vocals singing about a rainy morning.
[0:30 - 0:50] Chorus: Full band with upbeat drums and soaring
              synth leads. The lyrics are hopeful and uplifting.
