# Structured outputs

You can configure Gemini models to generate responses that adhere to a provided JSON
Schema. This ensures predictable, type-safe results and simplifies extracting
structured data from unstructured text.

Using structured outputs is ideal for:

* **Data extraction:** Pull specific information like names and dates from text.
* **Structured classification:** Classify text into predefined categories.
* **Agentic workflows:** Generate structured inputs for tools or APIs.

In addition to supporting JSON Schema in the REST API, the Google GenAI SDKs
make it easy to define schemas using
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) (Python) and
[Zod](https://zod.dev/) (JavaScript).

Recursive Structures

This example demonstrates how to extract structured data from text using basic
JSON Schema types like `object`, `array`, `string`, and `integer`.

### Python

```
from google import genai
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Ingredient(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the ingredient.")
    quantity: str = Field(description="Quantity of the ingredient, including units.")

class Recipe(BaseModel):
    recipe_name: str = Field(description="The name of the recipe.")
    prep_time_minutes: Optional[int] = Field(description="Optional time in minutes to prepare the recipe.")
    ingredients: List[Ingredient]
    instructions: List[str]

client = genai.Client()

prompt = """
Please extract the recipe from the following text.
The user wants to make delicious chocolate chip cookies.
They need 2 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda,
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 cup of unsalted butter (softened), 3/4 cup of granulated sugar,
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 2 large eggs.
For the best part, they'll need 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips.
First, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Then, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour,
baking soda, and salt. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar
until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla and eggs, one at a time. Gradually beat in the dry
ingredients until just combined. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop by rounded tablespoons
onto ungreased baking sheets and bake for 9 to 11 minutes.

## Streaming

You can stream structured outputs, which allows you to start processing the
response as it's being generated, without having to wait for the entire output
to be complete. This can improve the perceived performance of your application.

The streamed chunks will be valid partial JSON strings, which can be
concatenated to form the final, complete JSON object.

### Python

```
from google import genai
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal

class Feedback(BaseModel):
    sentiment: Literal["positive", "neutral", "negative"]
    summary: str

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "The new UI is incredibly intuitive and visually appealing. Great job. Add a very long summary to test streaming!"

response_stream = client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-3-flash-preview",
    contents=prompt,
    config={
        "response_mime_type": "application/json",
        "response_json_schema": Feedback.model_json_schema(),
    },
)

for chunk in response_stream:
    print(chunk.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text)
```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodToJsonSchema } from "zod-to-json-schema";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});
const prompt = "The new UI is incredibly intuitive and visually appealing. Great job! Add a very long summary to test streaming!";

const feedbackSchema = z.object({
  sentiment: z.enum(["positive", "neutral", "negative"]),
  summary: z.string(),
});

const stream = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
  model: "gemini-3-flash-preview",
  contents: prompt,
  config: {
    responseMimeType: "application/json",
    responseJsonSchema: zodToJsonSchema(feedbackSchema),
  },
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text)
}
```

## Structured outputs with tools

Gemini 3 lets you combine Structured Outputs with built-in tools, including
[Grounding with Google Search](/gemini-api/docs/google-search),
[URL Context](/gemini-api/docs/url-context),
[Code Execution](/gemini-api/docs/code-execution),
[File Search](/gemini-api/docs/file-search#structured-output), and
[Function Calling](/gemini-api/docs/function-calling).
