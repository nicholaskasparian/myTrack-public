# Vector search with Next.js and OpenAI

## Learn how to build a ChatGPT-style doc search powered by Next.js, OpenAI, and Supabase.

---

While our [Headless Vector search](/docs/guides/ai/examples/headless-vector-search) provides a toolkit for generative Q&A, in this tutorial we'll go more in-depth, build a custom ChatGPT-like search experience from the ground-up using Next.js. You will:

1. Convert your markdown into embeddings using OpenAI.
2. Store you embeddings in Postgres using pgvector.
3. Deploy a function for answering your users' questions.

You can read our [Supabase Clippy](/blog/chatgpt-supabase-docs) blog post for a full example.

We assume that you have a Next.js project with a collection of `.mdx` files nested inside your `pages` directory. We will start developing locally with the Supabase CLI and then push our local database changes to our hosted Supabase project. You can find the [full Next.js example on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search).

## Create a project[#](#create-a-project)

1. [Create a new project](/dashboard) in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Enter your project details.
3. Wait for the new database to launch.

## Prepare the database[#](#prepare-the-database)

Let's prepare the database schema. We can use the "OpenAI Vector Search" quickstart in the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql), or you can copy/paste the SQL below and run it yourself.

DashboardSQL

1. Go to the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **OpenAI Vector Search**.
3. Click **Run**.

## Pre-process the knowledge base at build time[#](#pre-process-the-knowledge-base-at-build-time)

With our database set up, we need to process and store all `.mdx` files in the `pages` directory. You can find the full script [here](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/blob/main/lib/generate-embeddings.ts), or follow the steps below:

1

### Generate Embeddings

Create a new file `lib/generate-embeddings.ts` and copy the code over from [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/blob/main/lib/generate-embeddings.ts).

```
1

curl \

2

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/main/lib/generate-embeddings.ts \

3

-o "lib/generate-embeddings.ts"
```

2

### Set up environment variables

We need some environment variables to run the script. Add them to your `.env` file and make sure your `.env` file is not committed to source control!
You can get your local Supabase credentials by running `supabase status`.

```
1

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=

2

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

3

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

4

5

# Get your key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

6

OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

3

### Run script at build time

Include the script in your `package.json` script commands to enable Vercel to automatically run it at build time.

```
1

"scripts": {

2

"dev": "next dev",

3

"build": "pnpm run embeddings && next build",

4

"start": "next start",

5

"embeddings": "tsx lib/generate-embeddings.ts"

6

},
```

## Create text completion with OpenAI API[#](#create-text-completion-with-openai-api)

Anytime a user asks a question, we need to create an embedding for their question, perform a similarity search, and then send a text completion request to the OpenAI API with the query and then context content merged together into a prompt.

All of this is glued together in a [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), the code for which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/blob/main/pages/api/vector-search.ts).

1

### Create Embedding for Question

In order to perform similarity search we need to turn the question into an embedding.

```
1

const embeddingResponse = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings', {

2

method: 'POST',

3

headers: {

4

Authorization: `Bearer ${openAiKey}`,

5

'Content-Type': 'application/json',

6

},

7

body: JSON.stringify({

8

model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',

9

input: sanitizedQuery.replaceAll('\n', ' '),

10

}),

11

})

12

13

if (embeddingResponse.status !== 200) {

14

throw new ApplicationError('Failed to create embedding for question', embeddingResponse)

15

}

16

17

const {

18

data: [{ embedding }],

19

} = await embeddingResponse.json()
```

2

### Perform similarity search

Using the `embeddingResponse` we can now perform similarity search by performing an remote procedure call (RPC) to the database function we created earlier.

```
1

const { error: matchError, data: pageSections } = await supabaseClient.rpc(

2

'match_page_sections',

3

{

4

embedding,

5

match_threshold: 0.78,

6

match_count: 10,

7

min_content_length: 50,

8

}

9

)
```

3

### Perform text completion request

With the relevant content for the user's question identified, we can now build the prompt and make a text completion request via the OpenAI API.

If successful, the OpenAI API will respond with a `text/event-stream` response that we can forward to the client where we'll process the event stream to smoothly print the answer to the user.

```

31

headers: {

32

Authorization: `Bearer ${openAiKey}`,

33

'Content-Type': 'application/json',

34

},

35

body: JSON.stringify(completionOptions),

36

})

37

38

if (!response.ok) {

39

const error = await response.json()

40

throw new ApplicationError('Failed to generate completion', error)

41

}

42

43

// Proxy the streamed SSE response from OpenAI

44

return new Response(response.body, {

45

headers: {

46

'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',

47

},

48

})
```

## Display the answer on the frontend[#](#display-the-answer-on-the-frontend)

In a last step, we need to process the event stream from the OpenAI API and print the answer to the user. The full code for this can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/nextjs-openai-doc-search/blob/main/components/SearchDialog.tsx).
